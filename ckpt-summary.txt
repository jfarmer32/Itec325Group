Summary of progress - require_once(teamname.php) - Justin Farmer
Progress report 1:
    I have been working with our 'admin-page.php', 'header.php', 'basic.css',
  'project-functions.php', and 'test-project-functions.php files'. Project-functions.php
  and test-project-functions.php will serve as our function and test-function files
  throughout the project. 'header.php' is the header that will appear on all pages,
  however, since the header present on each page will have slightly different variants
  for each page, a header function has been included in 'project-functions.php'.
  'admin-page.php' will serve as the page for admin, where they can view and modify
  the database. A CSS file, 'basic.css', has been started, and will contain all external
  CSS for our system. Some problems encountered: need header to change dynamically,
  (fixed with function), issues with displaying images dynamically as a grid
  (have working function to fix, needs improving), CSS keeps breaking the pages
  (fixed with CSS that hasn't broke, yet).

Progress report 2:
    I have continued to work in 'admin-page.php', 'header.php', 'basic.css', 'project-functions.php',
  and 'test-project-functions.php' files, adding to, improving and refactoring the code while
  working on the project. I added the file 'project-scripts.js', to contain any JavaScript
  functions related to the project. Within the 'project-scripts.js' file, there is a function
  to return the current date and time, and a function to dynamically style a dropdown menu.
  I plan to include more JS function to dynamically style our webpages. Some issues
  A couple issues I've encountered while working are trouble displaying table rows pulled from
  database (fixed by improving sql query), and trouble with pulling filtered rows from database
  (in progress, but can fix with improved queries).
