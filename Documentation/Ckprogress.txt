I have been working on the database portion of out project.  I have been gaining a handle on XAMPP (more specifically phpMyAdmin) in order to create our MySQL database.  Most of my issues have been with understanding of the phpMyAdmin interface, and what is requirements are in order to perform certain activities.  These activities include trivial things such as creating a Foreign Key.  This was simple to do in code but the interface for some reason doesn’t make it simple to find.  Somethings that we may have to worry about is indexing which is something we learned but didn’t really worry about in ITEC 340.  However, besides these minor things the tables for the most part have been created, so once these few kinks are worked out, the database will be populated and then backed-up and exported to Ben so we can set it up on our server.
