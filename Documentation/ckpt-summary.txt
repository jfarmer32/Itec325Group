Summary of progress - require_once(teamname.php) - Justin Farmer
    I have been working with our 'admin-page.php', 'header.php', 'basic.css',
  'project-functions.php', and 'test-project-functions.php files'. Project-functions.php
  and test-project-functions.php will serve as our function and test-function files
  throughout the project. 'header.php' is the header that will appear on all pages,
  however, since the header present on each page will have slightly different variants
  for each page, a header function has been included in 'project-functions.php'.
  'admin-page.php' will serve as the page for admin, where they can view and modify
  the database. A CSS file, 'basic.css', has been started, and will contain all external
  CSS for our system. Some problems encountered: need header to change dynamically,
  (fixed with function), issues with displaying images dynamically as a grid
  (have working function to fix, needs improving), CSS keeps breaking the pages
  (fixed with CSS that hasn't broke, yet).
