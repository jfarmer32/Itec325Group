Progress summary 2 & Problems encountered
Benjamin Lichtman, Chase Kuehn, Joe Sullivan, Justin Farmer

  Progress on our project has been proceeding as planned.
  Justin has continued his work on the'admin-page.php', 'header.php', 'basic.css', 'project-functions.php', and 'test-project-functions.php' files,
adding to, improving and refactoring the code while working on the project.  He added a file to house
the project’s JavaScript functions.  This file already contains functions to return the current date
and time as well as to dynamically generate a dropdown menu.  Some issues that he has encountered
during this work are trouble displaying table rows that have been pulled from the database
(this was later fixed by an improved sql query) and trouble pulling filtered rows from the database (this is currently in progress).
  Chase has continued to work with and oversee the database, including monitoring any issues that may
arise with the webpages and their connections to the database.  An issue that has come up is that the
database can manage a “limitless” number of content entries, but the website should not manage that many
images (for both aesthetic and efficiency reasons).  In order to keep user interest, a random selection of
content will be displayed on the page.  This limit will most likely have to be enforced through PHP.
  Joe has continued his work on the 'login.php' and 'user-page.php' files, implemetening and improving
orginal code to meet requirements. An issue occured with the 'login.php' when validating login, after login and getting the users info.
  Benjamin has implemented features on the landing page to deal with the database issues that Chase brought up, namely, the implementation of
a limit to the number of content panes (images with links) that can appear per user, such that the landing page scales and maintains the user experience.
Benjamin also implemented a check for content restriction (one of the columns of the content table) when the PHP program is adding content to the page.
This will allow content to be moderated via an administrator or the user that owns the content by simply not displaying restricted content.
