Progress summary 2 & Problems encountered
Benjamin Lichtman, Chase Kuehn, Joe Sullivan, Justin Farmer

Progress on the project has been proceeding as planned.  Justin has continued his work on the
'admin-page.php', 'header.php', 'basic.css', 'project-functions.php', and 'test-project-functions.php' files,
adding to, improving and refactoring the code while working on the project.  He added a file to house
the project’s JavaScript functions.  This file already contains to return the current date
and time as well as to dynamically generate a dropdown menu.  Some issues that he has encountered
during this work are trouble displaying table rows that have been pulled from the database
(this was later fixed by an improved sql query) and trouble pulling filtered rows from the database (this is currently in progress).
Chase has continued to work with and oversee the database, including monitoring any issues that may
arise with the webpages and their connections to the database.  An issue that has come up is that the
database can manage a “limitless” number of content entries, but the website should not manage that many
images (for both aesthetic and efficiency reasons).  In order to keep user interest, a random selection of
content will be displayed on the page.  This limit will most likely have to be enforced through PHP.
