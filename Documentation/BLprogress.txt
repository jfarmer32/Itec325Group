Summary of progress - require_once(teamname.php); - Benjamin Lichtman
	I have been working on a draft of the landing page. This landing page
was previously a stub that simply included sample text. The page now shows a
header that is implemented using our header.php file. The landing page also now shows sample content 'grid links' that are the central user focus of the site. 
These 'grid links' are fully functional the way they are intended to be in the 
final product, although implementing these with the database will be critical.
