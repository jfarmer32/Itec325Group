Progress summary & Problems encountered
Benjamin Lichtman, Chase Kuehn, Joe Sullivan, Justin Farmer

	Progress on our project is proceeding normally and our team plans to increase the rate at which 
  we are meeting, to meet the expected increase in workload for our project. Our web pages have
  been drafted and published to local, personal, and live servers for testing purposes. Our team
  has largely been drafting these pages individually and as a result, coordination of resources
  will be a crucial factor of our project in the coming weeks. Chase has been working on our
  database which presents a variety of challenges, as upon completion, our system will be heavily
  reliant on it. Some of these challenges include the first time use of phpMyAdmin to get a
  database working properly, more specifically, adding things such as foreign keys. An additional
  challenge with the database the coordinating it’s implementation with the rest of our system.
  Benjamin has been working on the landing page, creating an additional function in a ‘project
  utilities’ file to allow for the generation of the main ‘grid link’ content panes for our site,
  these ‘grid-links’ are the primary user focus of the system and are compromised of images that
  link to external URLs. Justin has been working on several of the administrative functions and
  has been building the administrative page accordingly. Justin also added a header function to
  the ‘project utilities’ and a CSS file to begin styling our system. Some challenges that have
  been encountered are the static nature of the header, and the CSS breaking the system. In order
  to find solutions to these challenges, and others, our team plans to meet regularly and discuss
  our individual challenges and form a plan and deadline accordingly.
